Hi! My name is Stanisław Nieradko and I'm a software engineer and computer science student.

I'm passionate about programming, software architecture and computer science in general. For now I'm mostly focused on backend web development and DevOps but I'm also interested in other areas of software engineering.

Alongside my studies at [Gdańsk University of Technology](https://pg.edu.pl/en/), I'm also working as a software developer at [Aspire Systems Poland](https://aspiresys.com/). At work I'm mostly using .NET, Azure cloud technologies and k8s.

If you are interested in my work or just want to chat, feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:stanislaw@nieradko.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stanislaw-nieradko/).
